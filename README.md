### This is a sample seed project for creating react projects - uses webpack and babel

### Step by step

# create the project folder

# npm init

# npm install webpack webpack-cli

# npm install @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react

# create a minimal .babelrc file to add presets

# create a minimal webpack config file to configure babel-loader module

# npm install react and react-dom

# create a sample component as component/Form.js

# create src/index.js - which is the entry point for webpack

# now run "npm run build" to create "dist/main.js"

# add these two more bundles for handling html with webpack: html-webpack-plugin and html-loader

# and add the module definition for html-loader and plugins for html-webpack-plugin in webpack configuration

# add a template html file at src/index.html

# run the build again - npm run build

# npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

# you are now ready to start the application: npm start
